# ATtiny85-SSD1306

These libraries were created by modifying  https://github.com/datacute/Tiny4kOLED and libraries and those downloaded from https://www.instructables.com/ATTiny85-connects-to-I2C-OLED-display-Great-Things/

I have separated the fonts into individual header files so that you only have to include those you require and there by saving precious ATtiny memory.
